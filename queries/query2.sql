-- This query is based off the physical cards that the case study provided us with,
-- in order to formulate our ERD. The business use of this query would be to display a
-- ward's current patients, admittance dates, staff and specialty.

-- Suggestion: Maybe COPY into a file on the end, to 'produce' the card?
