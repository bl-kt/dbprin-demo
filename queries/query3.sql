-- Business Use

-- The inspiration behind this query comes from my time as a drive-thru worker.
-- We had targets as to how quickly we should serve people - So I think it is feasible to suggest hospitals will have quotas on how quickly to treat people.
-- As such, the business use of this query is to view information related to tracking how quickly each patient is treated.
-- The query displays the time between a complaint being registered, and treatment starting, the length of time between treatment start and end, as well as total hospital time.
-- It then displays the average total hospital stay time, and how far from the average each patient's individual hospital stay is.
-- To summarise, this query can be used to ensure that the hospital staff are treating patients quickly enough - and if there are any problem points, they can be inferred from this query.
-- The inclusion of patient name and ward are to help infer problem areas, or to excuse outlier cases.
