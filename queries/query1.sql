-- This query is based off the physical cards that the case study provided us with,
-- in order to fomuuate our ERD. The business use of the query would be used to display
-- a patient's treatment history - previous complaints, treatments and who treated
-- them - alongside other relevant information.

-- Suggestion: Maybe COPY into a file on the end, to 'produce' the card?
-- where patient id = ?
-- tidy data
